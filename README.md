# PagerDuty Chrome Notifier
A Google Chrome extension to show PagerDuty notifications using Chrome's notification API. The notification will display some information about the alert, along with options to acknowledge and resolve it right from the notification!

All you need to do for it to work is to be logged into your PagerDuty subdomain, and have the extension installed. You don't need to keep the tab open, it will work on it's own.

## Future Work
* Add config option to include low ugency alerts.
* Add config option to use API Token instead of having to be logged in to subdomain.
