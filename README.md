# PagerDuty Chrome Notifier
A Google Chrome extension to show PagerDuty notifications using Chrome's notification API. The notification will display some information about the alert, along with options to acknowledge and resolve it right from the notification!

All you need to do for it to work is to have an active session on your PagerDuty subdomain, or provide a read-only API key to the extension.

## Configuration
When first installing the extension, it will automatically load the configuration page. You will need to provide your PagerDuty subdomain. Once saved, everything will start working.
